## **Nebulas** is a next-generation public blockchain, aiming for a continuously improving ecosystem. 

## Principles

The Nebulas blockchain has three major principles:

### Value ranking 

To enable value discovery in blockchain, **Nebulas Rank** measures multidimensional data in the blockchain world and powers the decentralized search framework. 

### Self-evolution 

To avoid the damage caused by forking to the blockchain, **Nebulas Force** enables rapid iteration and upgradability to its blockchain without the need for hard forks. 

### Native incentives

With forward-looking incentive and consensus mechanisms, the **Nebulas Incentive** rewards developers and users who contribute to the sustainability and growth of the ecosystem.
